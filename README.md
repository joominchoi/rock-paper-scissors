WIP:
- Refining content of project and its UI

Thoughts:
- I've become a lot more confident with using the developer tools to troubleshoot and identify where the program is not working as expected, particularly the use of breakpoints!

Learnings:
- Use hyphens instead of camelCase when naming IDs and Classes as recommended by this [doc](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#Background)
- How to use [DOM methods](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-dom-manipulation-and-events#dom-methods)
- How to use [Events](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-dom-manipulation-and-events#events)

Recapping:
- [Branches](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors#using-branches) and their respective Git commands
